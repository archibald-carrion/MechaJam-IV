The game will be a rogue like game, the main character is able to exit the mecha at almost any time to explore or solve puzzles. When the player destroy an enemie's mecha or an enemie drone, the enemis has a probability to drop scrap material that can be used to craft new pieces of mecha, or even in some rare case the enemie can drop piece of mecha of different values. Each end-level boss will drop a piece of mechas.
In-between each level, the player can rest in the mecha hangar were the mecha can be upgraded. In some cases, the player can rescue an npc inside a level and bring it back to the hangar, the npc will be able to upgrade the mecha in a different way than the player, for example the npc will perhaps be able to craft new paint for the mecha, or new attachments. 
Abilities and Actions: while inside the mecha, the player can shoots multiple kind of projectile, or attack in melee depending on the choosen attachments. While outside the mecha, the player can use a gun, but cannot use melee. The player can also interact with some item in the environment, but some specific items can only be interact while in the mecha or outside the mecha.
