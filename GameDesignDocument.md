The player will need to upgrade the new frame using the randomly given pieces of mecha. In each level of the game the player will be searching for hints to find the drivers thats destroyed the original mecha.

## Gameplay Mechanics
### Core Mechanics
The game will be a rogue like game, the main character is able to exit the mecha at almost any time to explore or solve puzzles. When the player destroy an enemie's mecha or an enemie drone, the enemis has a probability to drop scrap material that can be used to craft new pieces of mecha, or even in some rare case the enemie can drop piece of mecha of different values. Each end-level boss will drop a piece of mechas.
In-between each level, the player can rest in the mecha hangar were the mecha can be upgraded. In some cases, the player can rescue an npc inside a level and bring it back to the hangar, the npc will be able to upgrade the mecha in a different way than the player, for example the npc will perhaps be able to craft new paint for the mecha, or new attachments. 
Abilities and Actions: while inside the mecha, the player can shoots multiple kind of projectile, or attack in melee depending on the choosen attachments. While outside the mecha, the player can use a gun, but cannot use melee. The player can also interact with some item in the environment, but some specific items can only be interact while in the mecha or outside the mecha.

### Progression System
As explain previously, the player has multiple way to enhance the mecha:
* using scrap material to craft new pieces of mecha
* using the pieces of mecha dropped by enemies
* using the pieces of mecha dropped by bosses
* using the pieces of mecha given by the npc
* buying enhancement of mecha from the npc
* completing quests/challenges

## Story and Setting
### Game World
The game will take place in a dark cyberpunk world widely inspired by the post-modernism of Bladerunner and BLAME!
Each level of the game will show to the player a new map of this vast and abandoned industrial world, endless factories and corporate flats, each one more abandoned than the others.
The game does not explicitly tell the story of the world, if this place once was earth, or if there is even and end to this seemingly endless city. 
We let the imagination of the player fill the gaps and create his own story of this world. Only thing that is certain is that the player is not the only one human in this world, and that there is still powerfull corporations financing twar machines like mechas and drones.
### Backstory
The player thanks to the prologue will learn that the character is a mecha driver that before the game events was working for a corporation, but after a mission gone wrong, the player was left for dead in the middle of a hostile environment. Only a small group of drivers survived, but after doing small mercenary jobs, the group was embushed by a group of mechas led by a mysterious driver wearing the colors of the corporation that left the player for dead. 
Multiple drivers survived the ambush but the player was cut off from the group and the mecha was destroyed. 
At the end of the prolouge, the player will find a new frame of unknown mecha, the only thing that the player knows is that the mechas seems at the same time really ancient but wielding some unknown technology, as the player enter the mecha, the machine start talking to him, it's not you usual AI...

### Narrative Elements
The gameplay will present one main story and multiple side stories. The main story will be the one of the player trying to find the driver that destroyed his original mecha and the player searching for the survivors of the original group. 
The player can also investigated side-stories:
